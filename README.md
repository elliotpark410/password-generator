# password-generator

The password generator as an applicaton that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. As cybersecuriy threats grow, people would like to prevent valuable data from being stolen or damaged. One of the most effective ways to provide greater security is by creating a unique and unpredictable password. The application will run in the brwoser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. 

The user-selected criteria comes in the form of JavaScript a window prompt for password length and window confirms for the inclusion or exclusion of  character types. 

Password criteria:
* password is between 8 - 128 characters long
* lowercase characters
* uppercasse characters
* special characters
* numeric characters

## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how I generated a random password
* The for loop will add one random character incrementally until the password length is reached and it will only include character types that have been selected by the user

* The charAt method returns the character of a string at a specified position and the specified position is a random character because of (Math.floor(Math.random()) function 

```
for (let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
    randomPassword = randomPassword + includedCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * includedCharacters.length));
  }
  return randomPassword;
```

## Learning Points

* How to use charAt() method, Math.floor function, Math.random function, for loop, return statement, if/else statements, and how to declare variables
<br>

* The importance of scoping variables correctly and the importance of creating placeholder variables in the beginning
<br>

* For the most part, the computer will read code from top to bottom and left to right in a logical manner
